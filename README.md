# RsS-EJOR

## Introduction
This is the code related to the paper:
Andrea Visentin and Steven Prestwich and Roberto Rossi and S Armagan Tarim: *Computing Optimal (R,s,S) Policy Parameters by a Hybrid of Branch-and-Bound and Stochastic Dynamic Programming*, in European Journal of Operational Research, Under review.

## Structure
The structure of the repository is organised as follow
* **solvers/** - contains the different policy parameters algorithms. It contains a sub-folder for each policy (sS, RS, RsS).
* **util/** - contains additional classes used to generate the problem instances and simulate their behaviour.
* **experiment_non_stationary.py** - is an example of the solutions usage.
